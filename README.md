# Anonymous Peer Line [APL]

![APL](./github/banner.png)
## About
Light-weight (5kb), open-source video chat application for anonymous peer-to-peer calls. 

Built with WebRTC and Socket.IO, no account required, minimal setup, and fully self-hostable.

## Important
Please note: due to the lightweight architecture, the app may behave unexpectedly in 
non-standard scenarios (e.g., joining a second call without disconnecting from the first).  
Any issues can usually be resolved by simply refreshing the page.

## Usage

1. Make the installation
2. Open client.html

   *If you see "Socket.IO connected", everything is working correctly.* 
4. Select your id and give it other client
5. Connect!

## Installation

Server:

1. Install python3, git
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv git -y
```
2. Create virtual environment
```bash
mkdir ~/apl
cd ~/apl
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```python
pip install flask flask-socketio eventlet
```
4. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yanecoder/apl
```
5. [Optional] Firewall / Port forwarding
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```
6. Run server.py
```python
python server.py
```

Client:
1. Modify client.html

   Copy your server ipv4 and open client.html

   change server.py, LINE 53:
```js
const socket = io('http://YOUR-SERVER-IPV4:8443');
```

## Modification

### Port changing

Server:

1. Change server.py, LINE 38:

```bash
vim server.py
```
```python
socketio.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=YOUR-PORT)
```

2. Forward port
```bash
sudo ufw allow YOUR-PORT/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

Client:

Change client.html, LINE 53:
```js
const socket = io('http://YOUR-SERVER-IPV4:YOUR-PORT');
```
## Troubleshooting
- If the call does not connect, make sure port 8443 is open and your firewall allows it.
- If the app behaves unexpectedly after reconnecting, refresh the page.

## Contributing

Iâ€™m happy if you want to help improve the project!  
Feel free to contribute on GitHub by creating issues, submitting pull requests, or making your own forks. Every contribution is welcome!

## Version
v0.1

Currently, Socket.IO cannot easily serialize media streams, so screen sharing is not available during calls.  
This will be addressed in the next version.
